# Bio.hx
Bio.hx is a small helper library written in haxe, which is used in most of my haxe applications.

It contains a variety of small functions to simplify common tasks, such as string manipulation, file I/O and user interaction via command line.

## Installation
`haxelib git Bio https://github.com/Bioruebe/Bio.hx.git`
